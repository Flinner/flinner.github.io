Cleaning (La)Tex intermediate files in emacs invoke:
M-x TeX-clean to clean intermdiate files, and
C-u M-x TeX-clean to clean both intermediate files and outputs. or
C-c C-c then Choose Clean or Clean All
How does it actually work? TeX-clean looks into the variable LaTeX-clean-intermediate-suffixes for Regexs to search for files to delete when choosing Clean or invoking the function TeX-clean with no C-u prefix.</description></item><item><title>How to Typeset the micro symbol in MathJax</title><link>/posts/mathjax-micro-symbol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 08:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>/posts/mathjax-micro-symbol/</guid><description>So I tried googling the title and didn&amp;rsquo;t find a solution :)

Seriously? How did you end up here? :)
How to get your RSS feed To get straight to the point, just add .rss to the end of almost any reddit URL. Comments, Posts, Links, etc.
Example:
https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements.rss That is it!
My Feed reader is rejecting reddit urls! Use old.reddit.com
https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements.rss RSS feed is spammy! Ye what did you expect?</description></item></channel></rss>
